MockBukkit is a framework that makes the unit testing of Bukkit plugins a whole lot easier.
It aims to be provide complete mock implementation of CraftBukkit that can be completely controlled from a unit test.

## :mag: Usage

MockBukkit can easily be included in your project using either Maven or gradle.

> Note: The Breaking Changes intended for 3.0 were already made in 2.145.1. Due to an Error it didn't get properly tagged

<details>
<summary><h3>Adding MockBukkit via Gradle</h3></summary>

MockBukkit can easily be included in Gradle using the Maven Central and PaperMC repositories.
Make sure to update the version as necessary.


```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/' }
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'com.github.seeseemelk:MockBukkit-v1.20:3.9.0'
}
```

If you prefer to always have the latest Git version or need a specific commit/branch, you can always
use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#MockBukkit/MockBukkit) as your maven repository:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    maven { url 'https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/' }
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'com.github.MockBukkit:MockBukkit:v1.20-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Note: use `v1.13-SNAPSHOT` to test a Bukkit 1.13 plugin or any other version if
the [branch](https://github.com/MockBukkit/MockBukkit/branches) exists.
These branches will not be receiving patches actively, but any issues will be resolved and any pull requests on them
will be accepted.
This is because back-porting every single patch on every branch is incredibly time-consuming and slows down the
development of MockBukkit.

<details>
<summary><h3>Adding MockBukkit via Maven</h3></summary>

MockBukkit can easily be included in Maven using the default Maven Central and PaperMC repositories.
> Note: Make sure to update the version as necessary and put this dependency above your dependency that provides bukkit.

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>papermc</id>
        <url>https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.seeseemelk</groupId>
    <artifactId>MockBukkit-v1.20</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

The `test` scope is important here since you are likely to only be using MockBukkit during the `test` stage of your
Maven lifecycle and not in your final product.

If you prefer to always have the latest Git version or need a specific commit/branch, you can always
use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#MockBukkit/MockBukkit) as your maven repository:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>papermc</id>
        <url>https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.MockBukkit</groupId>
    <artifactId>MockBukkit</artifactId>
    <version>v1.20-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Note: use `v1.13-SNAPSHOT` to test a Bukkit 1.13 plugin or any other version if
the [branch](https://github.com/MockBukkit/MockBukkit/branches) exists.
These branches will not be receiving patches actively, but any issues will be resolved and any pull requests on them
will be accepted.
This is because back-porting every single patch on every branch is incredibly time-consuming and slows down the
development of MockBukkit.

### Using MockBukkit

A plugin can be loaded in this initialiser block.

```java
private ServerMock server;
private MyPlugin plugin;

@BeforeEach
public void setUp()
{
    server = MockBukkit.mock();
    plugin = MockBukkit.load(MyPlugin.class);
}

@AfterEach
public void tearDown()
{
    MockBukkit.unmock();
}
```

## :sparkles: Features

### Mock Plugins

MockBukkit contains several functions that make the unit testing of Bukkit plugins a lot easier.

It is possible to create a mock plugin.
This is useful when the plugin you are testing may be looking at other loaded plugins.
The following piece of code creates a placeholder plugin that extends JavaPlugin.

```java
MockPlugin plugin = MockBukkit.createMockPlugin()
```

### Mock Players

MockBukkit makes it easy to create several mock players to use in unit testing.
By running ```server.setPlayers(int numberOfPlayers)``` one can set the number of online players.
From then on it's possible to get a certain player using ```server.getPlayer(int i)```.

An even easier way to create a player on the fly is by simply using

```java
PlayerMock player = server.addPlayer();
```

A mock player also supports several simulated actions, such as damaging a block or even
breaking it. This will fire all the required events and will remove the block if the
events weren't cancelled.

```java
Block block = ...;
player.simulateBlockBreak(block);
```

### Mock Worlds

Another feature is the easy creation of mock worlds.
One can make a superflat world using one simple command:

```java
World world = new WorldMock(Material material, int heightUntilAir)
```

Using `Material.DIRT` and 3 as heightUntilAir will create a superflat world with a height of a 128.
At y=0 everything will be `Material.BEDROCK`, and from 1 until 3 (inclusive) will be `Material.DIRT`
and everything else will be `Material.AIR`.
Each block is created the moment it is first accessed, so if only one block is only ever touched only one
block will ever be created in-memory.

## :question: My tests are being skipped!? (UnimplementedOperationException)

Sometimes your code may use a method that is not yet implemented in MockBukkit.
When this happens MockBukkit will, instead of returning placeholder values, throw
an `UnimplementedOperationException`.
These exception extends `AssumationException` and will cause the test to be skipped.

These exceptions should just be ignored, though pull requests that add functionality to MockBukkit are always welcome!
If you don't want to add the required methods yourself you can also request the method on the issues page.
