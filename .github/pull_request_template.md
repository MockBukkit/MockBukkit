# For maintainer
When a PR is approved, the maintainer should label this PR with `release/*`.

- If the PR fixes a bug in MockBukkit, update the patch version. (if the current version is `0.4.1`, the new version should be `0.4.2`)
- If the PR adds a new feature to MockBukkit, update minor version. (if the current version is `0.4.1`, the new version should be `0.5.0`)

Note that a PR that fixes an `UnimplementedOperationException` should be considered a new version and not a bugfix.
