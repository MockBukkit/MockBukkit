MockBukkit documentation!
======================================

MockBukkit is a powerful framework that makes the unit testing of Bukkit plugins easy!
For each test, it will instantiate a mock server and provides methods of adding players
and controlling them easily.
It also gives the developer much more control over the scheduler, allowing quick and easy
testing of plugins that use timers or delays.
